# CarSharing-Report-with-SQL-Queries
## Overview
I am an aspiring Data Analyst with a growing passion for turning data into insights that drive decisions. Currently building my skills in:
- Data Cleaning & Exploration (Google Sheets,SQL)
- Data Visualization (Power BI)
- Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving
I use this space to document my learning journey, share projects, and practice real-world data analysis tasks â€” from exploring datasets to building dashboards.
I am particularly interested in applying data analytics to business decision-making, HR, and operations (but open to all domains as I learn).

Always open to feedback, collaboration, and new challenges
